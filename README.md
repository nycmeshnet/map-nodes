# NYC Mesh Nodes
___Generate GeoJSON from google spreadsheet___

This is a fork of https://github.com/nycoliver/nycmesh-nodes

The paths have been changed to work with the nycmesh.net site

The paths assume this folder, "map-nodes", and the "nycmeshnet.github.io" folder are both in the top level of the same directory. It will write directly to ../nycmeshnet.github.io/map/nodes. It will also look for pictures in ../nycmeshnet.github.io/panorama/

## Setup Instructions

Then, in this directory, run:
